I had a good interview with employer candidate L27 yesterday. I am hopeful it will lead to interview #2. Interview #2 will involve more scrutiny of my technical abilities, which is both fair and expected. As the position I'm seeking involves web development using Angular (js, html, css, Typescript, etc), I am adding Angular development to my growing List of Things. 

As it happens, I have had a wee idea for a small data-driven application that is an ideal use case for Angular web development, and so this project was born. 

I am about 3 full days into some excellent online Angular tutorials at the moment, and intend to double down on that by the end of the weekend; this project will slowly evolve as I learn how to implement the things I need to implement.

This repo will be become a portfolio piece to demonstrate my approach to building out small projects using Git, as I learn. For the purpose of this exercise, I will act as both the client (the fellow who needs the app built, in order to make the Big Monies), and the designer / developer (the fellow who needs to build the client's app on spec, and on time, in order to earn the Medium Monies). In truth of course, no Canadian currency will be exchanging hands, though I still reserve the right to fire myself, should the project go off the rails.
